## Project Overview
This project is focused on [brief description of what the project does]. This repository follows a Git workflow designed to streamline the development and deployment process.

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: [e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Django, Spring, React]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **CI/CD**: [e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions]
- **Hosting**: [e.g., AWS, Azure]

## Branching Strategy
This project follows a structured branching strategy to ensure a stable development cycle and smooth deployments.
- **master**: This is the main branch and contains production-ready code. All new features or bug fixes are merged here after passing SIT.
  
- **release**: The release branch is used to prepare a stable version for production. Merging into `release` signals a production deployment is ready.

- **release-hotfix**: This branch is used for hotfixes in production. Critical bugs are fixed here and merged back into both `master` and `release`.

- **feature/xxxx**: Development happens in feature branches, named using the format `feature/xxxx`, where `xxxx` is the feature name or ID.

## Development Workflow
1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   - Branch from `master`: 
     ```bash
     git checkout master
     git pull origin master
     git checkout -b feature/xxxx
     ```
   - Work on your feature and commit changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of the feature or fix"
     ```

2. **Push Your Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/xxxx
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request (PR) to master**

    - Once your code is ready, open a PR to merge the feature branch into master.

4. **SIT Environment Testing**
    - After merging to master, the SIT environment will automatically deploy for integration testing.
    - Once SIT passes, the feature is considered stable.

## Deployment Process
1. **Merge into the Release Branch**

    Once all features are approved from SIT, create a PR to merge the `master` branch into `release`.
    ```bash
    git checkout release
    git pull origin release
    git merge master
    ```
2. **Verify Production Deployment**
    - After deployment, monitor logs and key metrics to ensure the application is running smoothly in production.

## Hotfixes
If a critical issue is found in production, follow this process for hotfixes:

1. **Create a Hotfix Branch**
    ```bash
    git checkout release
    git pull origin release
    git checkout -b hotfix/xxxx
    ```
2. **Implement the Fix**
    - Make the necessary changes, commit, and push the branch.

3. **Merge Hotfix into release and master**
    - Create a PR to merge the hotfix branch into both release and master to ensure all environments stay consistent.

## Project Management & Tracking

## Useful Commands
### Pull Latest Changes from a Remote Branch
```bash
git pull origin branch-name
```

### Rebasing Your Feature Branch with master

Before merging, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the latest `master`:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout feature/xxxx
git rebase master
```

### Rollback a Deployment
If a deployment fails, rollback to the last stable commit:

```bash
git checkout release
git revert <commit-id>
git push origin release
```

### Run Tests Locally
To ensure your code passes all unit tests before pushing:

```bash
npm test
```
